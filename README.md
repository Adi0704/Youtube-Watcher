# Youtube-Watcher
The YouTube Watcher Application is a Python-based tool designed to monitor the view count of a YouTube video and notify the user via email when a specified threshold is crossed. This application is particularly useful for tracking the popularity of videos during events like Black Friday sales or for retrieving live data for analytical purposes.
